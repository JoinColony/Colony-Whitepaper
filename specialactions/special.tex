\subsection{Proposing an arbitrary transaction by the Colony contract}\label{sec:arbitrary-transaction}
It is desirable to have a mechanism by which a colony can create an arbitrary transaction on the blockchain to interact with contracts and tokens beyond those whitelisted by the network in advance. Such transactions should be rare occurrences with high threshold requirements.

Formally, proposing that a colony make an arbitrary transaction on the blockchain is no different from an objection; the proposal is to change the value of a special variable from zero to the value of the transaction data of the proposed transaction.\\
Such a proposal requires the entire colony to be able to vote (possibly both token holders and/or reputation holders), as it concerns actions taken `by the contract as a whole'. In the event the proposal is successful, the special variable is set. Another subsequent transaction - able to be made by anyone - is able to call a function that executes the transaction in the special variable, and resets it to zero if successful.

\subsection{Token-weighted, reputation-weighted and hybrid voting}
The majority of decisions in a colony are purely reputation weighted (even though creating a vote requires stake of both tokens and reputation), though there is no reason why a more traditional token-weighted vote shouldn't be available for some decisions, nor a hybrid vote based on both reputation and token holdings. In both of these cases, every account is allowed to vote, and in the case of a hybrid vote, all reputation is eligible to vote. When a hybrid vote takes place, the total reputation and the total token holdings each represent 50\% of the voting weight.

The primary use of a token weighted vote is related to the management of the colony tokens itself (Section \ref{sec:colony-token-management}); it seems reasonable that the decision and ability to create more tokens should lie with the colony token holders.

 

\subsection{Emergency Shutdown}\label{sec:big-red-button}
As indicated in section \ref{sec:escape-hatches}, a transaction from a whitelisted address can put a colony into `recovery mode' during which the state can be edited, the effects of bugs can be corrected and upgrades can be pushed. In addition to being able to stop-and-repair colonies, the reputation mining process will also have an emergency stop-and-repair mechanism (at least initially). This will allow the whitelisted addresses to revert the reputation root hash to a previous version and halt all updates to the reputation state until the issues have been resolved. The colonies will be able to continue operations as usual using the reputations of the last valid state.

\subsection{Example Configurations}\label{sec:example-configs}
The Colony Governance Protocol described in this document is concerned with what happens `on chain', i.e. those actions that directly affect the Ethereum blockchain. Users of the network however are not expected to ever interact with the contracts manually; instead they will be using some front-end application that makes all of the network's functionality appear intuitive and simple.\\
In any colony application we expect a certain amount of \textbf{front-end abstraction} in which complex tools and concepts are presented for the users' convenience, and translated in the background into a sequence of contract interactions on the colony network.

Front-end abstraction lets us realise certain functionality that doesn't \emph{seem} to be part of our protocol but can actually be coded into the governance system and made usable by a well designed application. Some examples follow.

\subsubsection{Salaried Positions}\label{sec:salary}

The work-for-payment model in the colony network is based around tasks, and you'd be forgiven for thinking that this implied colony-worker relationships that are purely transactional. However the system is in fact flexible enough to accommodate a wider range of employment models. One such example is a \emph{salaried position}.

A salaried position could be realised by creating a special domain representing the position to be filled. The domain could be issued the salary through a mandated funding proposal. The employee would be the only person with reputation within that domain and would be able to withdraw funds by creating and self-assigning placeholder tasks that are funded from the domain's pot. A good frontend could hide these implementation details from the users and render salaried positions differently from regular domains.

\subsubsection{Awarding Reputation Bonuses}

All reputation decays, as described in section \ref{sec:reputation}. This prevents an eternal `reputation aristocracy' and allows reputation to be meaningful even after major changes in the colony token's value. \\
Reputation is awarded when a user receives payment of colony tokens - usually as payout from a task. We can use this mechanism to award users extra reputation provided there is consensus to do so. 

Consider the scenario in which a founder, or an early important contributor to a colony has almost no reputation left by the time the colony starts earning revenue; perhaps the development of the product took a long time or perhaps the reputation decay rate was sub-optimally high for the particular colony\footnote{Finding an optimal decay rate for reputation in the network will depend on empirical data collected from early colonies. As with similar constants in this paper, the numerical values may change before the full network is live.}. To get around the limitations of the reputation system and to re-integrate the founder (and make them eligible to receive their just rewards), the colony can create a special `fake' task that is solely designed to award reputation. To qualify for the payout of tokens (and thereby the reputation), the user in question would have to give the same number of tokens back to the colony. Again, a good frontend abstraction could make such reputation awards easy and intuitive.

The important point is that any limitations imposed by the system can be weakened \emph{if there is consensus to do so}. The system should not stand in the way of consensus, it should just provide conflict resolution mechanisms for those times in which there is dissent.


\subsubsection{Objections by non-members}

Having reputation is a prerequisite for creating an objection and triggering the dispute process. Therefore, if an outsider is hired by a colony to perform a task, s/he will not, on their own, be able to object to the evaluation of their work.
However, a good colony frontend may allow them to create the template for an objection, effectively calling for members of the colony to support it and submit the objection to the colony network on-chain on their behalf.  
Just as a member may stake only 10\% of the required amount and wait for further support from their peers (Section \ref{sec:costs-of-disputes}), with the difference being that without any third party support, this `objection' would never be processed on-chain.
