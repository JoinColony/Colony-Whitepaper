\section{Reputation}



\subsection{Skill hierarchy}

The organisational hierarchy of a colony is described in section \ref{sec:domains}. In addition to this organisational hierarchy (which is unique to each colony), the Colony Network also maintains a hierarchy of skills, which is available for all colonies to use. A user's good or bad activity associated with either of these hierarchies will earn or lose them the corresponding reputation.

For example, when a task is created, as well as being placed in a particular domain in the colony, it is also tagged with a skill from the skill hierarchy. If the worker completes the task successfully, they will earn reputation in the relevant domain and skill. Conversely, if their work is found inadequate, they will lose the corresponding reputation.

When a task is completed successfully and paid out, if the payout is denominated in the colony's own token, the user also receives reputation.
