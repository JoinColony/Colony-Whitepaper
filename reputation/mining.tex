\section{Calculating Reputation: Miners and Merkle Proofs}\label{sec:reputationmining}
The reputation system is a core component of any decentralised colony. By carefully balancing the rewards and penalties we aim to keep every users' incentives aligned with the colony and the colony network. Since reputation can only be \emph{earned} and not bought, the system fosters a more meritocratic from of decision making than pure token-weighted voting can hope to achieve. The continuous decay of reputation ensures that the influence conveyed by reputation is recently earned and up-to-date. As such, it prevents a reputation aristocracy and allows for a fluid passing of control from one set of contributors to another over time.


Due to the combined complexity of reputation scores across multiple colonies, domains, and skills,
\textbf{reputation scores cannot be stored or calculated on-chain}. Instead, the calculations will all take place off-chain, the results of which will be reported to the blockchain by participating CLNY holders --- in a process resembling a proof-of-stake blockchain consensus protocol. We call this procedure \textbf{`Reputation Mining'}.

The reputation calculation whose result the miners are submitting, is determined by the activities that have taken place in the colonies and can be fully deterministically derived from the ethereum blockchain. Game-theoretically the system is protected similarly to the off-chain calculations of TrueBit (\cite{TruebitWhitepaper}) in that, \emph{while the calculation cannot be done on-chain and a correct submission can never be proved true, an incorrect calculation can always be proved to be wrong.}


\subsection{Merkle Trees and Proofs}\label{sec:merkle-summary}
This subsection contains only a summary of Merkle trees (\cite{MerkleTrees}, \cite{MerkleInEthereum}) and proofs to establish some terminology, and can be skipped if already familiar with them.

Consider the tree shown in Figure \ref{fig:merkleexample}. The data leaves of the tree (1, 2, 3 and 4) are each hashed individually to give A, B, C and D. These are then repeatedly hashed pairwise until only a single hash remains, indicated by G in Figure \ref{fig:merkleexample}. In the event of a starting or an intermediate array being an odd number (which will always happen for a starting array that is not a power of two), the hash contained in the last element is hashed with itself. 

The resulting structure is known as a Merkle tree. In order to prove that the element \ascode{1} is in the tree with root \ascode{G}, one submits a Merkle proof containing the information \ascode{1, [B,F], [l,l]}. The first argument is the element whose existence is to be proved. The second argument is the list of hashes that the hash of the first element should be hashed pairwise with. The last argument is an array of \ascode{l}'s and \ascode{r}'s that indicates whether the hash calculated so far should be hashed on the left or the right of next element in question. So to show that \ascode{3} was in the tree with root \ascode{G}, the proof would be of the form \ascode{3, [D,E], [l,r]}.

 \label{fig:merkleexample}
\end{figure}

Note also that the array of \ascode{l}'s and \ascode{r}'s nothing more than a binary representation of the leaf node's index in the tree. When expressed in this way, we refer to the index as the `path' in the Merkle proof. We refer to the objects that get hashed along the way (i.e. \ascode{D} and \ascode{E}) as the `siblings'.


\subsection{The Reputation Tree and the ReputationRootHash}\label{sec:reptree}
The data leaves in the reputation tree are the reputations all users have in all skills, as well as the colony-wide totals. Such a leaf consists of the following data:
$$
R = 
\begin{cases}
 rep\_id & \textnormal{the id of a skill or domain identifying the type of reputation},\\
 colony\_id & \textnormal{the colony the reputation is held in},\\
 user & \textnormal{the address holding the skill},\\
 amount & \textnormal{the numerical value of the reputation}.
\end{cases}
$$

All individual reputations are assembled into the \textbf{``Reputation Tree''} which is a Merkle tree of all individual reputations in a colony, as well as the total reputation of each type held by the users in each colony. The leaves that represent these colony-wide totals are indicated by setting \ascode{user} to zero. These leaves are then put into a Merkle tree in the usual way (described in Section \ref{sec:merkle-summary}).\footnote{The ordering of the data leaves is only determined by when these reputations were first earned.} We term the root hash of the resulting tree the \ascode{ReputationRootHash}, $\mathcal{RH}$.

\end{figure}


The \ascode{ReputationRootHash} is the only data we record on the blockchain associated with users' reputations. It summarises the state of the whole reputation system and whenever a user wishes to make use of their reputation, they can submit a Merkle proof from the reputation $\mathcal{R}_i$ they wish to make use of and ending at $\mathcal{RH}$.

\subsection{Calculating the new root hash}
To calculate the new root hash, the miners begin with the last reputation state, and decay all reputations held by all users in all colonies, in the order of the leaves in the tree. They then take the set of reputation gains or losses that were not in the last state submitted, and are to be included in the next state. They apply the reputation updates to each user in each colony, updating or adding leaves as necessary, to end up with a new list of reputations for all users and colonies. These new reputations are then hashed and assembled into a new Merkle tree yielding an updated \ascode{ReputationRootHash}.

While the calculation is too large to be done on-chain due to technical and economic limitations (i.e. the block gas limit and the cost of gas, respectively), this calculation can easily be performed by a typical user's computer.

\subsection{Submission of a new root hash}
%
\subsubsection*{What is submitted?}
The final \ascode{ReputationRootHash} is submitted to the contract by the miner along with the number of leaves in the tree. Further, the miner also submits the IPFS or Swarm hash of a document containing the entire state tree, though this is only for convenience; any user can construct this locally based on the blockchain history.
%
\subsubsection*{Who can submit a new root hash?}
CLNY token holders are eligible to become miners and participate in the reputation update process, but since any user can calculate the correct root hash locally, it would be possible for \emph{any} \rcth\ to submit the hash to the contract.

It is however undesirable to have too many submissions for every update. We propose a mechanism that only allows some miners to submit results to begin with. To participate in the mining process, \rcths\ must stake some of their tokens to become `reputation miners'. A submission will only be accepted from a miner if \ascode{SHA3(address, N, hash)} is below the \ascode{target}. At the beginning of the submission window, the target is set to 0 and slowly increases to $2^{256}-1$ after 150 blocks.

The variable $N$ that goes into the hash is some integer greater than 0 and less than the number of tokens the \rcth\ address has staked divided by $10^{15}$, meaning that users with a large stake have a higher chance of qualifying to submit a hash sooner than smaller stake holders. The factor of $10^{15}$ is introduced to ensure that all hashes a user is eligible to submit can be calculated in a few seconds by the client. It also effectively creates a minimum number of tokens that must be staked to submit a hash. This puts a tangible cost on any attacks revolving around spamming known false submissions (see Section \ref{sec:mining-possible-attacks}). 
%
\subsubsection*{Verifying a submission}
If only one state is submitted by the end of the submission period, then the new state is accepted, and proposals of the next state can begin to be made. This is expected to be the most common occurrence.

If more than one state has been submitted, then either someone has made a mistake, or there is a malicious entity trying to introduce a fraudulent reputation change. In this event, the a challenge-response protocol can establish which state is incorrect (see Section \ref{sec:challengeresponse})

\subsubsection*{Mining Rewards}

When a state is accepted, a number of (newly generated) \rcts\ are made available for the users who submitted the correct state to claim as a reward. They also receive a corresponding amount of reputation in the \rc\ (in a special mining skill, which only users in the \rc\ can earn by performing this task). This reputation update is no different from any other, aside from the limitations of who is able to earn it, and will be included in the subsequent reputation update cycle. The size of the rewards and their distribution are described in Section \ref{subsec:mining-costs-and-rewards}.

\subsection{Dealing with false submissions}\label{sec:challengeresponse}
%
\subsubsection{The Challenge-Response Protocol}
We assume that the correct hash is one of the  submitted hashes. This is a reasonable assumption, as only one out of all the miners is required to make a correct submission, and there is an incentive for them to do so (Section \ref{subsec:mining-costs-and-rewards}). Thus our task is not to validate the correct hash but to invalidate the false ones.

We must prove all but one submission incorrect by having each submission navigate a series of \emph{challenges}. These challenges refer to events that happened in the colony network within the last update cycle that have an effect on reputation. The \emph{responses} to the challenges are Merkle proofs that the corresponding reputation update was properly handled.

We consider first the scenario where only two submissions are made, and one is correct. 

\subsubsection*{1. The Justification Tree}
  \newcommand{\jrh}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{JRH}}}
 The first step is for both parties to upload a second Merkle root. This is the root of a tree where each leaf represents a complete reputation state i.e. each leaf is a \ascode{ReputationRootHash}. The right-most leaf ($\mathcal{RH}_n$) is the hash they originally submitted, and the left-most leaf ($\mathcal{RH}_0$) is the final accepted reputation state from the last update. The intermediate leaves ($\mathcal{RH}_i$) represent the evolution of the reputation state after the $n$ reputation updates in this cycle are applied one-at-a-time. We refer to the Merkle root of this tree as the justification root hash (\jrh).

\caption{The Justification Tree. Note that each intermediate leaf $\mathcal{RH}_i$ is hashed into the tree twice. }
\label{fig:justification-tree}
\end{figure}
An example of such a tree is shown in Figure \ref{fig:justification-tree}. Note that in the first stage of the tree, every neighbouring pair of data leaves is hashed, and so any pair has a shared Merkle proof to the root. We do this so that each element in the first row of hashes (indicated by $j_{0,1}, j_{0,2} ...j_{n-1,n}$ in Figure \ref{fig:justification-tree}) represents a transition between two states. It is these transitions that we wish to validate on-chain during the mining dispute resolution process, rather than the intermediate states themselves.

Any two differing submitted states agree on the first leaf $\mathcal{RH}_0$ (which is the \ascode{ReputationRootHash} accepted at the end of the previous iteration of the mining process), and disagree on the last leaf $\mathcal{RH}_n$. Somewhere there is a transition  ($j_{i,i+1}$ that represents the transaction between $\mathcal{RH}_i$ and $\mathcal{RH}_{i+1}$) where they agree on the starting state but disagree on the result. This transition is meant to be the effect of a single reputation update, the calculation of which is able to be done on-chain to establish which submission --- if either --- is correct.

First, however, we must establish where the two submissions first differ.

\subsubsection*{2. Searching for the discrepancy}
The contract now requires both parties to submit Merkle proofs that specific reputation updates were handled correctly. It begins by pseudorandomly\footnote{This pseudorandomness is to help mitigate an attack described in Section \ref{sec:mining-possible-attacks}. This affect the average runtime of the binary search, which still reduces the search space by a factor of two \emph{on average} every iteration.} picking the $i$th reputation update from all updates to be applied this cycle, (Appendix \ref{appendix:rep-transfer}) and requires both parties to provide:
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(i)] The root hash before the update was applied ($\mathcal{RH}_{i-1}$).
 \item[(ii)] The root hash after the update was applied ($\mathcal{RH}_i$).
 \item[(iii)] A Merkle proof showing that the pair ($\mathcal{RH}_{i-1}, \mathcal{RH}_i$) is correctly included in the justification tree.
\end{itemize}

When either party submits, first their Merkle proof is checked. It must use the correct sequence of \ascode{l} and \ascode{r} during the hashing process, which is defined by the $i$ that has been selected. If the Merkle proof is correct, then if this is the first party to submit, their $\mathcal{RH}^A_{i-1}$ and $\mathcal{RH}^A_{i}$ are stored. We label these with a superscript `A' to denote they have come from the first party to submit.

When the second party submits and their Merkle proof is found valid, then the contract compares the submitted $\mathcal{RH}^B_{i-1}$ and $\mathcal{RH}^B_{i}$ to $\mathcal{RH}^A_{i-1}$ and $\mathcal{RH}^A_{i}$ stored from the first party's submission.

If the pairs of submitted root hashes are identical, the (first) discrepancy between the two calculations occurs must occur later in the tree. The lower bound for the search for the first discrepancy can be set to $i+1$. If the submitted root root hashes are such that $\mathcal{RH}^A_{i-1}\neq\mathcal{RH}^B_{i-1}$ and $\mathcal{RH}^A_{i}\neq\mathcal{RH}^B_{i}$, then the first discrepancy must occur later in the tree. The upper bound for the search can be set to $i-2$.

This process repeats, pseudorandomly selecting a new $i$ within the still-valid bounds of the search for the new challenge. Each newly submitted proof further reduces the size of the search space by a factor of two on average.\footnote{By examining precisely at which sibling the first discrepancy occurs, some stages of the binary search could be skipped. However, in order to accomplish this all the siblings of the proof that first completed the challenge would need to be stored on the blockchain, so it is more gas efficient to do the na\"{i}ve binary search for all but the very smallest of trees.}

The process terminates when one party does not respond to a challenge, or the process finds the transition where $\mathcal{RH}^A_{i-1}=\mathcal{RH}^B_{i-1}$ but $\mathcal{RH}^A_{i}\neq\mathcal{RH}^B_{i}$. In the case of one party not responding, they forfeit and are assumed to be incorrect.

If the contract finds the reputation update where $\mathcal{RH}^A_{i-1}=\mathcal{RH}^B_{i-1}$ but $\mathcal{RH}^A_{i}\neq\mathcal{RH}^B_{i}$, the contract then requires each party to submit
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(iv)] A Merkle proof for the reputation ($R_j$) affected by the $i^{th}$ update transaction.
\end{itemize}
The Merkle proof supplied that proves the inclusion of $R_j$ (before the reputation update) in the root $\mathcal{RH}_{i-1}$ and the Merkle proof supplied of the inclusion of $R_j$ (after the reputation update) in the root $\mathcal{RH}_i$ must only differ in the state of $R_j$. This is because the trees $\mathcal{RH}_{i-1}$ and $\mathcal{RH}_i$ differ in only a single leaf (that of $R_j$). 

When either party submits valid Merkle proofs, showing that the before and after state they claim to be correct is included in the $\mathcal{RH}_{i-1}$ and $\mathcal{RH}_{i}$ in the \jrh\ they submitted, the reputation update is also calculated on-chain to determine whether the submitting party has done their calculation correctly. It is still possible at this point that the first submitter is incorrect,\footnote{This is due to the possible addition of a new reputation node that is a duplicate of a previous one. This is explained fully in Section \ref{sec:earning-rep-for-first-time}.}  and so final resolution waits until either the second party forfeits through inaction, or demonstrates that the first submitter was wrong.

In the event of more than two submissions for the new $\mathcal{RH}_n$, this process is conducted in parallel between multiple pairs of submitted hashes, and then repeated, until only one submission remains.

If less than an hour elapses from submissions opening to only one submission remaining, the next submission window only opens when a hour has passed from the start of this window. If more than an hour has passed, the next submission window opens immediately.



\subsection{Calculating Reputation Updates}\label{sec:calculating-reputation-updates}
%
\subsubsection{Keeping track of reputation changes}
%
Fundamentally, there are two types of reputation update that occur:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Decay of existing reputation.
 \item Addition or removal of reputation as a reward or punishment.
\end{itemize}


Recall also from section \ref{sec:reptree} that a reputation consists of
\begin{center}
\[
R = 
\begin{cases}
 rep\_id & \textnormal{the id of a skill or domain identifying the type of reputation},\\
 colony\_id & \textnormal{the colony the reputation is held in},\\
 user & \textnormal{the address holding the skill},\\
 amount & \textnormal{the numerical value of the reputation}.
\end{cases}
\]
\end{center}

%I suggest we do a little appendix of data structures. That way we can refer to reputations and rep_ids an other data here without having to fully document it here. We would not need to even mention the parent_id and parent_n_id here (as we need it only elsewhere)...

Furthermore for each $rep\_id$, the following data is also known
\[
  rep\_id \rightarrow 
  \begin{cases}
    parent\_id &	\textnormal{the rep\_id of the parent domain/skill}\\
    parent\_n\_id &	\textnormal{the rep\_id of the $n^{th}$ parent}\\
    generation &	\textnormal{total number of parents}\\
    children\left[\cdots\right] &	\textnormal{array of children}\\
    n\_children &	\textnormal{total number of children}
  \end{cases}
\]
When a user earns reputation in a skill or domain, s/he also earns reputation in all parents and thus corresponds to \ascode{generation+1} number of reputation updates. Alternately, when a user loses reputation, they also lose reputation in all parents and all children representing a total number of updates of \ascode{generation + n\_children + 1}. (Note: parent\_id and parent\_n\_id are not used here; they are used during dispute escalation - see Section \ref{sec:disputes}).

It is only by recording the number of parent reputations (\ascode{generation}) and how many reputations have been updated already in this update cycle (via \ascode{n\_updates}) that the resolution protocol is able to perform the binary search of the justification state trees submitted by the disagreeing users. At the start of the challenge protocol, the contract can look up the last entry in the update table for the cycle under consideration, and work out how many updates have occurred in this cycle based on the number of updates prior and the number of parent reputations. It can then conduct the binary search.

When the discrepant state transition is found, the users supply the index of the update on-chain that corresponds to that reputation update. This means that the contract does not have to iterate over the whole list expensively, but the contract can easily check the correct reputation update is being considered, and then confirm that the calculation made corresponds to the correct reputation update. In the event that the discrepant transaction is a decay transaction, which is easily determined by the Merkle path corresponding to an index smaller than the number of leaves in the tree at the end of the last successful update, they must also supply a Merkle proof that the starting value assumed for the user corresponds to the value that user had at the end of the last update cycle.

Recording the number of leaves in the tree is required to allow the binary search to occur and accommodate the decay calculations that must be done at the start of each update. Before any new reputation is earned or lost in an update cycle, all existing reputations owned by users decay (see Section \ref{sec:repdecay}). There is a decay calculation for every leaf in the previously accepted tree. We do the decay calculations first to give users the benefit of the doubt during reputation updates so they do not lose reputation they have only just earned to premature decay.

\subsubsection{Earning reputation for the first time}\label{sec:earning-rep-for-first-time}
When a user earns reputation in a new skill, at least one new leaf is added to the tree --- if they have not earned reputation before in some of the parents, then they will also cause further new leaves to be added. New leaves will also be added if they are the first user in a colony to earn those particular skills, making the total reputation for that skill in the colony non-zero. During a dispute, when the user proves that they have included the update in the tree, it is not possible to check (efficiently) on-chain that they should not have added it to an existing leaf instead. However, because during a dispute we are always playing two submissions off against the other, one of two things will be true:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Both submissions add a new leaf to the tree. If there was a discrepancy, then it is in the maths conducted on this leaf, not the addition of the leaf itself. The maths can be checked on-chain to establish which result is correct.
 \item The other submission adds the new reputation to an existing leaf (the correctness of which can be checked on-chain easily). In this case, the user who added the leaf incorrectly is wrong.
\end{itemize}





\subsubsection{Transfers of reputation between accounts}\label{sec:reptransfer}

The most important quality of reputation that distinguishes it from a token is that it is tied to an account and cannot be transferred. However, in the event of disputes (Section \ref{sec:disputes}) it can happen that one party to a dispute loses reputation while the other gains. This process has to be modelled as a `reputation transfer' to ensure that reputation is never created in this process (i.e. the reputation lost by the loser is at least as much as the reputation gained by the winner).

If an entry in the reputation update log indicates that the reputation has come from another user, then this entry represents updates of all the parents of the reputation being gained by one user, and updates of all the parents and children of the reputation being lost by the other. However, we have to ensure that the user who is losing reputation still has the reputation to lose if another user is gaining it.

To achieve this, all the transactions that correspond to updating the reputations of the user gaining the reputation are done first. In the event such a transaction must be proved to be correct in the resolution protocol, the users can provide a proof of the losing user’s reputation, prior to them losing it in this update, and this can be compared to the amount of reputation intended to be gained. Whichever is smaller is used as the amount of reputation the user is gaining during the calculations.

Then, when calculating the reputation deduction to be applied to the losing user, the reputation that was used for as the voting weight should be done last i.e. all the children (and parents) should be considered first, as it is the amount of the reputation that was eligible to vote that will determine the fraction lost of each of the children reputation. %If any of these calculations need to be proved correct during the resolution protocol, 

For further details about reputation transfers and disputes, see Appendix \ref{appendix:rep-transfer}.

\subsubsection{The Reputation Decay Calculation}\label{sec:repdecay}
The reputation decay process was described above as being continuous. In practise, it will decay a little bit during each reputation update cycle following an exponential decay. However, such a calculation is not possible to do accurately on-chain, so we must use an approximation. The details of the approximation we use, and a proof that this approximation is accurate and will not affect the running of (active) colonies can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:rep-decay}.

\subsection{Denial of service attacks}\label{sec:mining-possible-attacks}

In the event of multiple submissions, finding the correct one takes time --- the timeout $t$ for the challenge-response must be reasonable to allow the transaction defending a submission to propagate and be mined. A denial-of-service attack is therefore possible, whereby an attacker makes many false submissions. However, if these false submissions were random hashes, unable to be defended, then none would be defended correctly within the first five minute window, and the attack would quickly end. 

The denial of service attack (to delay a proper reputation update) can only be sustained when the false submissions are incorrect only in some leaves, and the majority of the state tree is correct. In this scenario, the attacker successfully defends each of their submissions for as long as possible to delay the resolution of the reputation mining protocol as much as possible.

Any such attack is capped by the first round of pairings of submissions against each other. Even if the attacker made millions of submissions, only a finite number of those would be able to be successfully defended due to the block size --- currently, no more than 4500 submissions would be able to be defended, even if the attacker used up all block space during the timeout.\footnote{These figures assume $1.5\pi\times10^6$ gas in a block, and that each transaction is only 21000 gas for a worst-case-scenario calculation.} With only 4500 submissions able to make it to the second round, the length of time the DoS attack would be sustained for is given by 

$$t \times \left\lceil\log_2\left(4500\right)\right\rceil\times \left\lceil\log_2\left(N_{\rm updates}\right)\right\rceil$$

\noindent where $N_{\rm updates}$ is the number of reputation updates that have been made in this update cycle. To arrive at this figure, we know there will need to be $\left\lceil\log_2\left(4500\right)\right\rceil$ rounds of comparison between submissions to eliminate all but one. Each round will require $\left\lceil\log_2\left(N_{\rm updates}\right)\right\rceil$ interrogations of the justification tree to establish where the two submissions being compared differ. Finally, each interrogation can take up to $t$ before it is considered to have timed out and one or both of the submissions is deemed invalid. The product of these three factors tells us how long this reputation update can be delayed by an attacker.

Long term, $N_{\rm updates}$ will be dominated by the decay transactions rather than by any updates that have occurred since the last reputation state was established. Even if the Colony Network were wildly successful, with 100000 colonies, each with 1000 users that had earned some reputation in 1000 different skills in each of the structural and skill hierarchies, the delay to the reputation updates would only be around $36$ hours.

There would be little effect on the rest of the colony network in this time. Users would still be able to exercise their reputation from the previous reputation update, and continue to influence decisions with that reputation. Indeed, this shows what perhaps the main motivation for such an attack would be --- if a user knew that they had been `caught' behaving badly, and was due to lose all their reputation, they might try such an attack to eke out the last bits of influence they possibly could. However, decisions in the colony network do not resolve quickly, and in a well-developed colony we would not expect any one person to have a large amount of reputation when compared to the rest of the colony, so it seems unlikely they would be able to unduly influence decisions significantly while conducting the attack.

Assuming this attack continued, then the reputation mining protocol would effectively only update every 36 hours. Users staking would become more susceptible to variance in terms of the rewards, but otherwise little would change in the day-to-day functioning of any individual colony. 

However, the attacker would lose \emph{all} the \rct\ that they had staked (which would be around 4500 times the expected minimum stake) in order to perform the attack, and so would have to buy more to attack again making this attack exceedingly expensive.


Note: There is an edge case to consider in which the attacker is sending enough defending transactions to completely fill the blocks. In such a case however we assume that the defence of the legitimate state is always successfully included in block, as a one-off increase in gas costs will always be worthwhile to ensure the legitimate state is defended.  

\subsection{Costs and Rewards of Mining}\label{subsec:mining-costs-and-rewards}
In order to be involved in the reputation mining process, \rcths\ must stake their tokens with the Colony Network Contract. This allows them to submit a reputation hash as part of the reputation mining process described above.

If they submit a new hash, this is recorded and they are noted as the first address to submit that hash. If they submit a hash that has already been submitted, they are appended to a list of users that have submitted that hash.

If a hash is found to be incorrect, all those who submitted it lose their stake. If a hash is found to be correct, however, the users who submitted it gain root colony tokens and reputation. The total amount of reputation earned is controlled by the amount of reputation that exists in the colony, and tries to ensure that 25\% of the reputation in a colony comes from mining. If normal activity in a colony generates $A$ reputation per hour, the total reputation that exists $R$ is given by 

\begin{equation}
\frac{A}{1-\exp\left(-k\right)}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $k$ is the decay constant used in each update period (see Appendix \ref{}). If we wish for 25\% of $R$ to come from mining, then the amount of reputation earned from mining in each update period should be 

\begin{equation}
\frac{R}{4}\left(1-\exp\left(-k\right)\right).
\end{equation}

When a user makes their submission, their weighting for that hash is recorded, and the total weight submitted by all users for that hash is updated. A staker's weight is given by 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:stakerweight}
\left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{t}{T}\right)\right) \times \frac{1}{n+S} \times B
\end{equation}

where $B$ is the total number of tokens they have staked, $n$ is their position in the list, $S$ and $T$ are normalising constants, and $t$ is the number of blocks they have staked their tokens for. 

The first factor in equation \eqref{eq:stakerweight} encourages users to stake their tokens for long periods of time. After $T$ blocks, this first factor is 0.63 of what it will eventually grow to given unlimited time. We expect $T$ to represent around a month.

The second factor in equation \eqref{eq:stakerweight} encourages users to submit the hash as soon as possible, with this factor becoming smaller the later users submit; the first submission will have approximately twice the weight of the last submission, all other factors being equal. This factor also means that users are not incentivised to split up their holdings, as some of the split up tokens will have lower weightings. $S$ should be a number on the order of the number of people that are staking in each round to ensure the discrepancy between the rewards for being first and last are not huge; it should be under the control of the \rc.

The last factor $B$ is the number of tokens the user has staked --- if they have staked more tokens, they get more of the payout than they would have done if they had staked less.


%Notes:\\
%-token holders must stake in order to be miners\\
%-reputational reward comes from tokens earned just like task payout
%-how much rep exactly you get (similar to 5 star rating for work) determined by how long you lock your tokens. Short term = 3 stars, long term 5 stars.\\
%-how many tokens are paid out to miners must vary as the price of the token changes. Idea: make it scale with the total paid out in other domains of root colony. If feasible, use one month rolling average. Prevent miners overpowering rest of root colony with too much reputation.
%- $k$ should be multiplied by the number of hours since the last update to accommodate for attack
%- Merkle proof of current $R$ should be submitted with hash, otherwise not accessible on-chain?
