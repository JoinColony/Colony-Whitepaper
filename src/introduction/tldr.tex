\subsection*{Introduction}

Colony is the people layer of the decentralised protocol stack --— an emerging collection of technologies built on Ethereum, which provide open, permissionless protocols for developers to create sophisticated products without having to build complex backend software. Augur provides a layer for prediction, 0x for exchange, Golem for computation, and Colony for human capital.

The Colony Protocol allows developers to integrate decentralised and self regulating division of labour, decision making, and financial management into their applications.

Colony brings about a new `Nature of the Firm' \cite{The-Nature-of-the-Firm} by significantly reducing both the transaction costs of the market exchange mechanism for labour, and trust required for people to work together. This innovation makes pseudonymous, peer-to-peer organisations possible. Rather than centralised ownership and hierarchical management, smart contracts distribute ownership according to the value each individual contributes, and influence emerges from the bottom up through systematic peer review of contributed work.

This paper seeks to describe and define our best current understanding of the Colony protocol, but touches only lightly on use cases. Specifically, it discusses only on-chain actions. In many areas, subject to use case, off-chain functionality will be beneficial. This may include messaging or informal polling, but as it does not need to happen on-chain, the specifics of how this occurs are beyond the scope of this document.

The Colony protocol is intended to be flexible and extensible. As it is the most challenging manifestation to consider, this permutation is designed with low trust, decentralised environments in mind. However, subsets of the functionality in different configurations would be applicable in different circumstances, such as where greater centralisation of trust is desired.

We envisage this protocol being integrated into a variety of applications. It could form the basis of a decentralised ridesharing service, claims handling in an insurance dApp, or to provide the framework by which a merchants’ guild coordinates in a virtual world.
