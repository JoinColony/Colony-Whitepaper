\subsection*{Organizations, for the Internet}

The Colony Network is an Ethereum-based protocol for creating and operating Internet Organizations. In a traditional organization, rules are defined in policy documents and enforced by a management hierarchy; in an Internet Organization, rules are defined in code and enforced by a blockchain mining process. \\

Automating business rule enforcement makes organizational models which previously involved high coordination costs, such as Holacracy, more feasible. More exciting still, this automation enables entirely new and previously impossible organizational forms to come into being. By reducing the trust needed for people to collaboratively manage shared funds and enforce standards of conduct, it becomes possible to coordinate the entirety of an organization’s operations via market-style interactions, rather than through the internal processes of a firm. \\

An Internet Organization’s operations are not \textit{necessarily} analogous to traditional company processes, such as project management, budgeting, and decision-making, although they certainly \textit{can} be, and indeed Colony’s own application (\texttt{https://colony.io/connect}) is modeled that way. We anticipate the Colony protocol will be used to build economic incentives and decision-making mechanisms for platforms whose content or value proposition is created by users \textit{without top down decision-making of any kind}. Examples may include a photo-sharing app which meritocratically divides revenue between users, a driver-run P2P ridesharing service, crowdsourced claims handling in an insurance dApp, or a merchants’ guild in a virtual world. \\

This is primarily a technical document describing the current design of the Colony protocol, focusing on on-chain actions and affordances. In many cases off-chain functionality, such as messaging or other forms of signalling, will be essential for the proper functioning of the organization. However, as that communication is not consensus-relevant, it does not need to happen on-chain, so the specifics of how it might occur are not treated here. \\

Onward!
