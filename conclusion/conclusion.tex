\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have described and defined the Colony Protocol --- an organisational operating system built on Ethereum. It provides a general purpose framework for the creation, management, and operation of decentralised organisations of various kinds.

The specification contained herein represents our current best description of the Colony Protocol. It is however, a working document, and it should be expected that the final specification will differ substantively, both as a consequence of the rapidly changing technological landscape, and the refinement of our understanding of the requirements of decentralised organisation through iterative cycles of development and user testing.
