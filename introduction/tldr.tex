\subsection*{Introduction}
%\textbf{Introduction}\\
Colony enables teams, communities, companies, and other kinds of organisations, to divide labour, distribute authority, and manage finances, pursuant to the execution of a common project, without requiring collaborators know, or trust one another.

Popularly referred to as Decentralised Autonomous Organisations

This paper represents our best current understanding of the Colony protocol. Theory however, rarely survives contact with reality. The eventual implementation is likely to differ from the specification contained herein, both as a consequence of the rapidly changing technological landscape, and empirical data gathered through iterative product development cycles.
