\subsection{Colony Network Overview}
This section provides only a very broad summary of the functionality we are proposing, with the detials

Users wishing to collaborate on a project would come together to form a colony, represented by a series of smart contracts on the Ethereum network. These contracts provide the governance mechanisms for the users to make decisions collectively about the project that they are working on together.

The key feature of the Colony Network is the underlying reputation system. This is used to quantify the historical contributions of users to a colony, and to make sure they are justly rewarded going forward. It is also used to ensure that, when resolving a dispute, the opinions of users who have demonstrated relevant knowledge are weighted appropriately. 

When the colony pays out rewards, the more reputation a user has the greater the reward they receive --- i.e. those that have contributed the most gain the greatest benefit.
